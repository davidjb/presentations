    Ask about open source, who has used software?
    Who has contributed something?

    Don't say effectively, actually

What is open source?
====================

.. note::

   * **A development process involving openly sharing blueprints and ideas.**
   * Content is freely licenced (*free*, as in speech)

   * In terms of software:

     * iOS/iTunes: just because it's $0 doesn't make it *open source*.
     * **Developers**: make source code freely available for reuse & review
     * **Users**: get the ability to access and change source code (without
        restriction)
     * **Community**: bonds together to fix issues and add features

Who uses open source?
=====================

.. note::

   * Me (this presentation, my OS etc)
   * You (websites you load)
   * Everyone!  (browsers)
   * Yes, even Windows users.
   * ~82% of web content involves open source.

   So this is all well and good, but how can this benefit me?

Why open source?
================

.. note::

    Why?  A 2014 survey from BlackDuck (OpenHub) of professionals:
    * Cost (maintenance etc)
    * Higher quality
    * Freedom of changing code
    * Better features, higher
    * Security
    * Access to skill bases.

    It shows, since closed source is using open source...

* Cost, quality, customisation, security, ease of deployment,
  maintenance effort.  (2014 survey, BlackDuck/OpenHub)

* It shows; closed source builds on open source:

  * iOS, Mac OS X, Windows (kinda)
  * Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft Azure...

Awesome, but how can this benefit me?
=====================================

    What do you call a Linux volunteer who just contributed his or her 6th patch
    to the Linux kernel? **Hired**.

    The in-joke is that after 5, you'll already have a job offer.

    From a corporate POV, it shows O/S in use, and in demand.



Open opportunities: open source
===============================

.. note::

    Involvement in Open source benefits everyone, especially someone
    personally.

    * **Jobs & employment.** Employers want to see what you've done. Your
      contributions form your automatic CV.

    * **Knowledge and skills.** Learn by doing on real-world projects.

      Improve your knowledge: tools, methods, collaboration, Negotiation, best
      practice

    * **Minimise effort.**  Save time, effort, money by not reinventing the wheel.

      Do things you couldn't do before without the skill!

    * **Connect with the world.**  Be part of a team from all across the world.

      I work alone, but with so many people.  I'm part of someone else's
      massive team without knowing it; interesting feeling

    * **Make a difference.** Your contributions will help you and others.

      Open source community is passionate.  It's more than just a job so tend
      to care more.

* **Jobs & employment.** Employers want to see what you've done. Your
  contributions form your automatic CV.

* **Connect with the world.**  Be part of a team from all across the world.

* **Make a difference.** Your contributions will help you and others.


Getting started
===============

.. note::

    * Create profiles: free source code hosting, automatic profiles of
      activity.  Embrace version control (tutorials etc); its importance can't
      be overstated. Not just 3AM when something goes wrong.  GH and BB have
      education freebies.

    * Release your code:  if it's helped you, it'll help others.  Marketing
      not required; people will find you.

    * Leverage other projects:  if something does what you need, use it or
      adapt it.

    * Contribute back: something wrong, create an issue.  Suggest features.
      Submit patches or pull requests of code.

    * Attend conferences, user groups:  mostly major cities in Australia, but
      there's always room for more groups in region Centres.

    * Be open:  you can't know everything, but you can learn from others.
      There's always new ideas.




* **Create your profile.** Sign up for `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ and
  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ accounts.

* **Release your code.** If it helps you, it'll help others.

* **Leverage other projects.** Don't reinvent the wheel.

* **Contribute back.**  Participate by reportng issues, submitting features, &
  working with the community on solutions.

* **Attend conferences & user groups.**  Get further involved.

* **Be open to new ideas.**  It's a fast moving space!


Myth busting
============

.. note::

   * **I can't help.**  It's not all about programming, anyone can add fixes.

   * **I can do it all myself.**  Nginx web server took 123 years to make and
     $6m.  Got that money?

   * **Open source isn't safe.**  More eyes on the code make it safer. Open
     source makes audits easy.  Responsible disclosure and always more
     attentive than closed source.

   * **I can't get support.**  Open technologies have wider skillbases and you
     aren't locked in to a company or vendor.  Communities are willing to
     help.

   * **There's no money to be made.**  Sell development, provide SaaS,
     sell support to Enterprise.

   * **Closed source is cheaper.**  Price of freedom?
     What if a vendor/company disappears?  Starts charging lots more?
     what's your escape plan?  Open source, just pick someone else.

   * **I can't work in a regional area.**  Open source is everywhere.
     Companies hire remotely.
