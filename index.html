<h2>What is open source?</h2>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Development process, which encourages the sharing of concepts or
designs, and allowing improvements, under a free licence (free, in terms
of freedom of speech).</li>
<li>Fundamentally represents the freedom of content and ideas, sharing,
collaboration.</li>
<li>Any idea can be open source, not just those related to IT:  beverages,
content (books/movies/pictures), research, Government.  Through sharing,
reuse and collaboration, everyone benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of software developers, this is the concept of making source code
freely available in such a way that others may reuse, adapt, and
redistribute it as they see fit.</p>
<p>In terms of software users, this means you can download or access a
program, a library, etc without restriction, and legally give copies away
to your friends (or the world).</p>
<p>Anyone can make zero-cost software or make code available publicly, but
this doesn't make it open source.  It needs to be but licenced correctly
for open reuse and redistribution. Most things tend to be.  Selling: It is
possible to sell open source code, but for most practical intents and
purposes, open source code will be available for zero cost.  See the OSI
for the full definition and comparison with 'free software'.</p>
<p class="last">In addition, being community-minded and open to accept criticism,
contributions, and collaboration around further development embody the
open source ethos for software.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A development process</li>
<li>Open sharing of concepts, designs and work.</li>
<li>Freely licenced, in terms of <em>freedom</em> of speech</li>
<li>Any idea can be open source...<ul>
<li>but just because it's $0 or doesn't make it <em>open source</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software:<ul>
<li><strong>Developers</strong>: making source code openly available (without restriction)</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong>: get the ability to access, change, view source code (without
restrction)</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong>: open to accept criticism, contributions &amp; foster
collaboration</li>

<h2>Open source, open resume</h2>

<div class="admonition note">

<p>Improve your knowledge, skills</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Technical tools</li>
<li>Project methodology</li>
<li>Negotiation and collaboration</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Discussion and communication</li>
<li>Industry best practices</li>
<li>... so much more ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Reduce effort: re-use free code and benefit.  I would never succeed on
projects without open source; I just don't have the skill or time.</p>
<p>Job offers: Employers are looking at your public profile; just like how
they're looking at those photos of you on Facebook, they want to see your
(positive) contributions.  Sometimes this will happen automatically --
employers are out there.  I've had several job offers so far.</p>
<p>Minimise effort: If you've had a problem, someone else may well have
already solved it.  If they haven't solved it entirely, help them.  Or,
make your own code.</p>
<p>Stand on the shoulders of giants: reap the benefits.  Build upon open code
from others, add features, rework functionality, contribute fixes back to
the world at large.</p>
<p>You're not alone: I typically work alone, but I work with all these people
beside me.  For me, I'll probably never meet these people.  For someone
else, I'm one of their team of 1000s of people and I might well never
know.  That's an interesting feeling.</p>
<p>The open source community is likely to be more receptive to support
requests.  I can't count the number of times I've had to deal with company
support staff that either don't understand, can't help, or don't care.
Dealing directly with a contributor on a software project means they can
make a difference!</p>
<p>Connecting with IT in the wild:  I'm alone in an office in Townsville, but
I can actually be an integral part of development.  Numerous bugs I've
fixed and issues I've reported have affected many others.</p>

<li><strong>Job offers.</strong> Employers want to see what you've done. Your contributions are
yours and form your automatic CV.</li>

<li><strong>Connect with the world.</strong><ul>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Condition yourself: Be open to new ideas. Remember there are lots of good
ideas and technology out there. Reinventing the wheel is okay, if there's
a good reason.  Make sure it's a good one before you do.</p>
<p>Create social coding profiles:  get a GitHub and Bitbucket profile.  You
get a lot for free, including code hosting.  Social coding platforms and
social media are great starting points.  If you're not familiar with
version control, learn through free tutorials.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Free code hosting</li>
<li>Connect with other projects</li>
<li>Lots more tools, especially for students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out OpenHatch: complete 'training m issions' and gain skills. Find
simple(ish) tasks to work on.</p>
<p>Contribute back: If you're working with open
technologies, and notice something wrong, create an issue.  Work with the
developer to see it through.</p>
<p>Target open source: Actively seek and power your projects with open
source -- make sure they're free and unencumbered.  If something goes
wrong, you can fix it or debug it and you're guaranteed later versions
will be free too.</p>
<p>Release your own code: You can charge f
or support, ask for donations for feature requests, etc, but odds are
you'll benefit from people using and contributing to your own code, if
it's open and free.</p>
<p>Be open and accepting:  Remember that others out there could be making
their very first contribution to open source too.  You might beneFind
projects you're interested in: If something doesn't work correctly, don 't
get upset, jump in and help sort it out.  Noone is perfect, and software
is just the same.  Odds are if you've hit a bug, someone else will soon
(or has already).</p>
<p>Attend conferences, user groups:  mostly major cities in Australia, but
there's always room for more groups in region Centres.</p>
<p class="last">Open resume: Create an online resume and make it open too.  Consider
making an open source repo for your resume.  There's coding tools like
JSONResume that you can use to create beautiful looking resumes.</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>First steps.</strong>  Look at open source projects. Be open to new ideas.</li>

<article class="slide level-2" id="myth-busting">

<h2>Myth busting</h2>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Can't help: Code is the core, but you don't have to programme to make a
difference.  Anyone can report bugs and contribute to an open bug reports,
or suggest features. Adding or editing documentation is usually just as
easy to fix speling mistakes.</p>
<p>Myself: With open source, you can make projects you never dreamed of or would never
have the time to handle.  It's safter
and quicker in the short term, and long term.  Try implementing a web
server from scratch.  If you've got 123 years (Nginx, OpenHub) and $6.7m,
go for it.  You might succeed, and maybe you can buy yourself a community
too.  Good luck.  Alternatively, I promise to do this for you &amp; maintain it
forever for $6m...interested?   If something really bugs you, submit a
patch.  If something really, really bugs you (MySQL â†’ MariaDB, OpenOffice â†’
LibreOffice), fork the project.  You're probably not alone.</p>
<p>Support: With open source code, you have flexibility and a wide range of
people with skill in your software.  Flexibility to choose, more than just
1 vendor,  as the software is open, or use the community for free.  The
community grows together, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Safety:  having open source code is safer than closed source.  Communities
have 'responsible disclosure' frameworks and tend to care because it
reflects on them.  Regular audits are possible because you and others can
see and review the code.</p>
<p>Can't make money: run software as a service (skilled people will run their
own, you charge for service for those that can't be bothered),  payment
for support (Enterprise support, eg Canonical/Ubuntu), feature additions,
donations, Gittip.  Getting a good job sounds pretty beneficial to me!</p>
<p>People will steal my ideas: licensing controls how code is used, you
maintain copyright (although you don't have to, public domain is
possible), commits are recorded with your details.  Theft is always
possible, but you're shipping software: piracy is always a fact of life.
FYI: if you've got some magic secret sauce to a startup, then you can
definitely keep it to yourself; consider making libraries, support code,
other things you can benefit from help with.</p>
<p class="last">Cheaper:  what if a vendor/company disappears?  Starts charging lots more?
What's your escape plan?</p>
</div>
<ul class="build simple">
<li><strong>I can't help.</strong>  It's not all about programming.  It's easy to contribute.</li>
<li><strong>I can do it all myself.</strong>  Maybe, if you're Google.</li>
<li><strong>Open source isn't safe.</strong>  More eyes on the code make it safer. Open
source makes audits easy.</li>
<li><strong>I can't get support.</strong>  Open technologies have wider skillbases.
Communities are willing to help.</li>
<li><strong>There's no money to be made.</strong>  Sell support, provide SaaS, charge for
further dev.</li>
<li><strong>Closed source is cheaper.</strong>  What's the price of freedom?</li>
</ul>
