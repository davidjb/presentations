What is open source?
====================

.. note::

    * Development process, which encourages the sharing of concepts or
      designs, and allowing improvements, under a free licence (free, in terms
      of freedom of speech).
    * Fundamentally represents the freedom of content and ideas, sharing,
      collaboration.

    * Any idea can be open source, not just those related to IT:  beverages,
      content (books/movies/pictures), research, Government.  Through sharing,
      reuse and collaboration, everyone benefits.

    In terms of software developers, this is the concept of making source code
    freely available in such a way that others may reuse, adapt, and
    redistribute it as they see fit.

    In terms of software users, this means you can download or access a
    program, a library, etc without restriction, and legally give copies away
    to your friends (or the world).

    Anyone can make zero-cost software or make code available publicly, but
    this doesn't make it open source.  It needs to be but licenced correctly
    for open reuse and redistribution. Most things tend to be.  Selling: It is
    possible to sell open source code, but for most practical intents and
    purposes, open source code will be available for zero cost.  See the OSI
    for the full definition and comparison with 'free software'.

    In addition, being community-minded and open to accept criticism,
    contributions, and collaboration around further development embody the
    open source ethos for software.

* A development process
* Open sharing of concepts, designs and work.
* Freely licenced, in terms of *freedom* of speech

* Any idea can be open source...

  * but just because it's $0 doesn't make it *open source*.

* Software:

  * **Developers**: making source code openly available (without restriction)
  * **Users**: get the ability to access, change, view source code (without
    restrction)
  * **Community**: being open to accept criticism, contributions & foster
    collaboration


Who uses open source?
=====================

.. note::

    Browsers (Firefox, Chromium)
    OSes and servers (Linux, BSD)
    Phones (Android, Firefox)
    Web servers (Apache/Nginx)
    Databases (MySQL/MariaDB, Postgres)
    Web sites (CMSes, platforms, frameworks)
    Programming languages (Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl…)

    So this is all well and good, but how does this benefit me?

* **Why?**  Quality, freedom, features, security, ease of deployment, cost.

* Closed source uses open source as well:

  * iOS, Mac OS X, Windows (kinda)
  * Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft Azure...
  * Many companies release code as open source libraries and modules



Awesome, but how does this benefit me?

.. note::

    The joke is that after 5, you'll already have a job offer.

    The complete article is well worth a read, and covers essentially
    everything that I've talked about.


Open source, open resume
========================

.. note::

    Improve your knowledge, skills

    * Technical tools
    * Project methodology
    * Negotiation and collaboration
    * Planning
    * Discussion and communication
    * Industry best practices
    * ... so much more ...

    Reduce effort: re-use free code and benefit.  I would never succeed on
    projects without open source; I just don't have the skill or time.

    Job offers: Employers are looking at your public profile; just like how
    they're looking at those photos of you on Facebook, they want to see your
    (positive) contributions.  Sometimes this will happen automatically --
    employers are out there.  I've had several job offers so far.

    Minimise effort: If you've had a problem, someone else may well have
    already solved it.  If they haven't solved it entirely, help them.  Or,
    make your own code.

    Stand on the shoulders of giants: reap the benefits.  Build upon open code
    from others, add features, rework functionality, contribute fixes back to
    the world at large.

    You're not alone: I typically work alone, but I work with all these people
    beside me.  For me, I'll probably never meet these people.  For someone
    else, I'm one of their team of 1000s of people and I might well never
    know.  That's an interesting feeling.

    The open source community is likely to be more receptive to support
    requests.  I can't count the number of times I've had to deal with company
    support staff that either don't understand, can't help, or don't care.
    Dealing directly with a contributor on a software project means they can
    make a difference!

    Connecting with IT in the wild:  I'm alone in an office in Townsville, but
    I can actually be an integral part of development.  Numerous bugs I've
    fixed and issues I've reported have affected many others. 

    * Most IT development happens overseas, typically capitals
    Yes, even regional Queensland.


* **Job offers.** Employers want to see what you've done. Your contributions are
  yours and form your automatic CV.

* **Knowledge and skills.** Learn by doing in a real-world project.

* **Minimise effort.**  Save time, effort, money and stop reinventing the wheel.

* **Connect with the world.**

  * Be part of a huge team; one you may never meet
  * Just because we're not in Silicon Valley doesn't mean anything.



Getting started
===============

.. note::

    Condition yourself: Be open to new ideas. Remember there are lots of good
    ideas and technology out there. Reinventing the wheel is okay, if there's
    a good reason.  Make sure it's a good one before you do.

    Create social coding profiles:  get a GitHub and Bitbucket profile.  You
    get a lot for free, including code hosting.  Social coding platforms and
    social media are great starting points.  If you're not familiar with
    version control, learn through free tutorials.

    * Free code hosting
    * Connect with other projects
    * Lots more tools, especially for students.

    Check out OpenHatch: complete 'training m issions' and gain skills. Find
    simple(ish) tasks to work on.

    Contribute back: If you're working with open
    technologies, and notice something wrong, create an issue.  Work with the
    developer to see it through.

    Target open source: Actively seek and power your projects with open
    source -- make sure they're free and unencumbered.  If something goes
    wrong, you can fix it or debug it and you're guaranteed later versions
    will be free too.

    Release your own code: You can charge f
    or support, ask for donations for feature requests, etc, but odds are
    you'll benefit from people using and contributing to your own code, if
    it's open and free.

    Be open and accepting:  Remember that others out there could be making
    their very first contribution to open source too.  You might beneFind
    projects you're interested in: If something doesn't work correctly, don 't
    get upset, jump in and help sort it out.  Noone is perfect, and software
    is just the same.  Odds are if you've hit a bug, someone else will soon
    (or has already).

    Attend conferences, user groups:  mostly major cities in Australia, but
    there's always room for more groups in region Centres.

    Open resume: Create an online resume and make it open too.  Consider
    making an open source repo for your resume.  There's coding tools like
    JSONResume that you can use to create beautiful looking resumes.


* **First steps.**  Look at open source projects. Be open to new ideas.

* **Create social coding profiles.**  Get `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ and
  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ profiles.  (`Example
  <http://git.io/djb>`_)

* **Leverage open source.** Actively seek to power your projects with open
  components.

* **Grow organically.** It's easiest to learn about & contribute to what
  you're working on or interested in.

.. nextslide::
    :increment:

* **Contribute back.**  If something's wrong or could be better, report an
  issue. Work with the developer to solve it.

* **Release your own code.** If the code helps you, it'll help others.

* **Be open and accepting.** It might be someone's first contribution.

* **Create an open resume.** Create an online resume, and make it open too.

* **Attend conferences, user groups.**  In person, online; get further
  involved.


Making a difference
===================

* Your contributions **will** help others and their work **will** benefit you.

  * You might even help yourself!

* You can make a difference from anywhere, and any job.

* Be proud that your work could power organisations everywhere.


Myth busting
============

.. note::

   Can't help: Code is the core, but you don't have to programme to make a
   difference.  Anyone can report bugs and contribute to an open bug reports,
   or suggest features. Adding or editing documentation is usually just as
   easy to fix speling mistakes.

   Myself: With open source, you can make projects you never dreamed of or would never
   have the time to handle.  It's safter
   and quicker in the short term, and long term.  Try implementing a web
   server from scratch.  If you've got 123 years (Nginx, OpenHub) and $6.7m,
   go for it.  You might succeed, and maybe you can buy yourself a community
   too.  Good luck.  Alternatively, I promise to do this for you & maintain it
   forever for $6m...interested?   If something really bugs you, submit a
   patch.  If something really, really bugs you (MySQL → MariaDB, OpenOffice →
   LibreOffice), fork the project.  You're probably not alone.

   Support: With open source code, you have flexibility and a wide range of
   people with skill in your software.  Flexibility to choose, more than just
   1 vendor,  as the software is open, or use the community for free.  The
   community grows together, everyone wins.

   Safety:  having open source code is safer than closed source.  Communities
   have 'responsible disclosure' frameworks and tend to care because it
   reflects on them.  Regular audits are possible because you and others can
   see and review the code.
   
   Can't make money: run software as a service (skilled people will run their
   own, you charge for service for those that can't be bothered),  payment
   for support (Enterprise support, eg Canonical/Ubuntu), feature additions,
   donations, Gittip.  Getting a good job sounds pretty beneficial to me!
   
   People will steal my ideas: licensing controls how code is used, you
   maintain copyright (although you don't have to, public domain is
   possible), commits are recorded with your details.  Theft is always
   possible, but you're shipping software: piracy is always a fact of life.
   FYI: if you've got some magic secret sauce to a startup, then you can
   definitely keep it to yourself; consider making libraries, support code,
   other things you can benefit from help with.

   Cheaper:  what if a vendor/company disappears?  Starts charging lots more?
   What's your escape plan?


.. rst-class:: build

* **I can't help.**  It's not all about programming.  It's easy to contribute.

* **I can do it all myself.**  Maybe, if you're Google.

* **Open source isn't safe.**  More eyes on the code make it safer. Open
  source makes audits easy.

* **I can't get support.**  Open technologies have wider skillbases.
  Communities are willing to help.

* **There's no money to be made.**  Sell support, provide SaaS, charge for
  further dev.

* **Closed source is cheaper.**  What's the price of freedom?

So, now what?
=============

.. note::

   Make your code open: open code helps others with similar problems. Promote
   your open code, people will eventually find you.

   Remember you have the right to change their code!  However, if you make
   improvements try to submit a pull request or patch back to the original
   author.

   Follow your passions:  if you're interested in getting further involved,
   projects may have ways of being part of code review teams, issue triage,
   support, etc.  IRC channels, and so forth.


* Open source is fundamental to development
* It's easy to get started now:

  * Create your accounts.  Establish an identity.
  * Choose open source projects for your work
  * Grow your skills
  * Contribute: bug reports, suggestions, patches
  * Make your own code open for others
  * Get further involved in projects and make a difference.

* Provide prospective employers with public profile URLs
* Follow your passions!
