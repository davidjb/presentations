What is open source?
====================

.. note::

    * Development process, which encourages the sharing of concepts or
      designs, and allowing improvements, under a free licence (free, in terms
      of freedom of speech).
    * Fundamentally represents the freedom of content and ideas, sharing,
      collaboration.

    * Any idea can be open source, not just those related to IT:  beverages,
      content (books/movies/pictures), research, Government.  Through sharing,
      reuse and collaboration, everyone benefits.


* **A development process involving openly sharing blueprints and ideas.**
* Content is freely licenced (*free*, as in speech)

* In terms of software:

  * iOS/iTunes: just because it's $0 doesn't make it *open source*.
  * **Developers**: make source code freely available for reuse & review
  * **Users**: get the ability to access and change source code (without
    restriction)
  * **Community**: bonds together to fix issues and add features


Who uses open source?
=====================

.. note::

   * Me (this presentation, my OS etc)
   * You (websites you load)
   * Everyone!  (browsers)
   * Yes, even Windows users.
   * ~82% of web content involves open source.

    So this is all well and good, but how can this benefit me?

Why open source?
================

.. note::

    Why?  Higher quality, freedom of changing code, better features, higher
    security, access to skill bases.

    It shows, since closed source

* Cost, quality, customisation, security, ease of deployment,
  maintenance effort.

* It shows; closed source builds on open source:

  * iOS, Mac OS X, Windows (kinda)
  * Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft Azure...

Awesome, but how can this benefit me?
=====================================

    What do you call a Linux volunteer who just contributed his or her 6th patch
    to the Linux kernel? **Hired**.

    The joke is that after 5, you'll already have a job offer.

    From a corporate POV, it shows O/S in use, and in demand.



Open opportunities: open source
===============================

.. note::

    XXX Rework

    Involvement in Open source benefits everyone, especially someone
    personally.

    Improve your knowledge: tools, methods, collaboration, Negotiation, best
    practice

    Reduce effort: re-use free code and benefit.  I would never succeed on
    projects without open source; I just don't have the skill or time.

    Job offers: Employers are looking at your public profile; just like how
    they're looking at those photos of you on Facebook, they want to see your
    (positive) contributions.  Sometimes this will happen automatically --
    employers are out there.  I've had several job offers so far.

    Minimise effort: If you've had a problem, someone else may well have
    already solved it.  If they haven't solved it entirely, help them.  Or,
    make your own code.

    Stand on the shoulders of giants: reap the benefits.  Build upon open code
    from others, add features, rework functionality, contribute fixes back to
    the world at large.

    You're not alone: I typically work alone, but I work with all these people
    beside me.  For me, I'll probably never meet these people.  For someone
    else, I'm one of their team of 1000s of people and I might well never
    know.  That's an interesting feeling.

    The open source community is likely to be more receptive to support
    requests.  I can't count the number of times I've had to deal with company
    support staff that either don't understand, can't help, or don't care.
    Dealing directly with a contributor on a software project means they can
    make a difference!

    Connecting with IT in the wild:  I'm alone in an office in Townsville, but
    I can actually be an integral part of development.  Numerous bugs I've
    fixed and issues I've reported have affected many others. 
    
    You can be part of a huge team that you'll never meet.

    * Most IT development happens overseas, typically capitals
    Yes, even regional Queensland.

    Your contributions will make a difference in organisations everywhere,
    even without you knowing.

* **Jobs & employment.** Employers want to see what you've done. Your
  contributions form your automatic CV.

* **Knowledge and skills.** Learn by doing on real-world projects.

* **Minimise effort.**  Save time, effort, money by not reinventing the wheel.

* **Connect with the world.**  Be part of a team from all across the world.

* **Make a difference.** Your contributions will help you and others.


Getting started
===============

.. note::

    XXX Rework

    Condition yourself: Be open to new ideas. Remember there are lots of good
    ideas and technology out there. Reinventing the wheel is okay, if there's
    a good reason.  Make sure it's a good one before you do.

    Create social coding profiles:  get a GitHub and Bitbucket profile.  You
    get a lot for free, including code hosting.  Social coding platforms and
    social media are great starting points.  If you're not familiar with
    version control, learn through free tutorials.

    * Free code hosting
    * Connect with other projects
    * Lots more tools, especially for students.

    Contribute back: If you're working with open
    technologies, and notice something wrong, create an issue.  Work with the
    developer to see it through.

    Target open source: Actively seek and power your projects with open
    source -- make sure they're free and unencumbered.  If something goes
    wrong, you can fix it or debug it and you're guaranteed later versions
    will be free too.

    Release your own code: You can charge f
    or support, ask for donations for feature requests, etc, but odds are
    you'll benefit from people using and contributing to your own code, if
    it's open and free.

    Be open and accepting:  Remember that others out there could be making
    their very first contribution to open source too.  You might beneFind
    projects you're interested in: If something doesn't work correctly, don 't
    get upset, jump in and help sort it out.  Noone is perfect, and software
    is just the same.  Odds are if you've hit a bug, someone else will soon
    (or has already).

    Attend conferences, user groups:  mostly major cities in Australia, but
    there's always room for more groups in region Centres.

    Open resume: Create an online resume and make it open too.  Consider
    making an open source repo for your resume.  There's coding tools like
    JSONResume that you can use to create beautiful looking resumes.


* **Create your profile.** Sign up for `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ and
  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/>`_ accounts.

* **Release your code.** If it helps you, it'll help others.

* **Leverage other projects.** Don't reinvent the wheel.

* **Contribute back.**  Participate by reportng issues, submitting features, &
  working with the community on solutions.

* **Attend conferences & user groups.**  Get further involved.

* **Be open to new ideas.**  It's a fast moving space!


Myth busting
============

.. note::

   Can't help: Code is the core, but you don't have to programme to make a
   difference.  Anyone can report bugs and contribute to an open bug reports,
   or suggest features. Adding or editing documentation is usually just as
   easy to fix speling mistakes.

   Myself: With open source, you can make projects you never dreamed of or would never
   have the time to handle.  It's safter
   and quicker in the short term, and long term.  Try implementing a web
   server from scratch.  If you've got 123 years (Nginx, OpenHub) and $6.7m,
   go for it.  You might succeed, and maybe you can buy yourself a community
   too.  Good luck.  Alternatively, I promise to do this for you & maintain it
   forever for $6m...interested?   If something really bugs you, submit a
   patch.  If something really, really bugs you (MySQL → MariaDB, OpenOffice →
   LibreOffice), fork the project.  You're probably not alone.

   Support: With open source code, you have flexibility and a wide range of
   people with skill in your software.  Flexibility to choose, more than just
   1 vendor,  as the software is open, or use the community for free.  The
   community grows together, everyone wins.

   Safety:  having open source code is safer than closed source.  Communities
   have 'responsible disclosure' frameworks and tend to care because it
   reflects on them.  Regular audits are possible because you and others can
   see and review the code.
   
   Can't make money: run software as a service (skilled people will run their
   own, you charge for service for those that can't be bothered),  payment
   for support (Enterprise support, eg Canonical/Ubuntu), feature additions,
   donations, Gittip.  Getting a good job sounds pretty beneficial to me!
   
   People will steal my ideas: licensing controls how code is used, you
   maintain copyright (although you don't have to, public domain is
   possible), commits are recorded with your details.  Theft is always
   possible, but you're shipping software: piracy is always a fact of life.
   FYI: if you've got some magic secret sauce to a startup, then you can
   definitely keep it to yourself; consider making libraries, support code,
   other things you can benefit from help with.

   Cheaper:  what if a vendor/company disappears?  Starts charging lots more?
   What's your escape plan?


.. rst-class:: build

* **I can't help.**  It's not all about programming.  It's easy to contribute
  :strike:`speling correcxions` spelling corrections.

* **I can do it all myself.**  Maybe, if you're Google.

* **Open source isn't safe.**  More eyes on the code make it safer. Open
  source makes audits easy.

* **I can't get support.**  Open technologies have wider skillbases.
  Communities are willing to help.

* **There's no money to be made.**  Sell support, provide SaaS, charge for
  further dev.

* **Closed source is cheaper.**  What's the price of freedom?

* **I can't work in a regional area.**  Open source is everywhere. Companies
  hire remotely.
