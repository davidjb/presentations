Are you...
==========

* Looking for ways to improve your career prospects?
* Want new skills to open up a range of opportunities?
* Want an instant portfolio to show your future employers?
* Think you'd like to make a real difference to real-world projects?

Let's look at how **open source** can help with all of the above!


Who am I?
=========

* IT Honours graduate from JCU in 2008
* Worked with the JCU eResearch Centre since

* Developer (web applications)
* System automator and administrator (Linux, Salt, Vagrant)
* Project manager
* Software to support research and development

* Work primarily with open source

  * Professional work would fall short
  * My personal projects wouldn't succeed
  * I simply couldn't do as much.


What is open source?
====================

.. note::

    It a development process which encourages the sharing of concepts or
    designs, and allowing improvements, under a free licence (free, in terms
    of freedom of speech).  Fundamentally represents the freedom of content
    and ideas, sharing, collaboration.

    Any idea can be open source, not just those related to IT:  beverages,
    content (books/movies/pictures), research, Government.  Through sharing,
    reuse and collaboration, everyone benefits.

    In terms of software developers, this is the concept of making source code
    freely available in such a way that others may reuse, adapt, and
    redistribute it as they see fit.

    In terms of software users, this means you can download or access a
    program, a library, etc without restriction, and legally give copies away
    to your friends (or the world).

    Anyone can make zero-cost software or make code available publicly, but
    this doesn't make it open source.  It needs to be but licenced correctly
    for open reuse and redistribution. Most things tend to be.  Selling: It is
    possible to sell open source code, but for most practical intents and
    purposes, open source code will be available for zero cost.  See the OSI
    for the full definition and comparison with 'free software'.

    In addition, being community-minded and open to accept criticism,
    contributions, and collaboration around further development embody the
    open source ethos for software.


* Development process involving the open sharing of concepts and designs
* Freely licenced, in terms of *freedom* of speech
* Any idea can be open source
* Just because it's zero cost or available doesn't make it *open source*
* Software:

  * Developers: making source code openly available without restriction
  * Users: the ability to access, change, view source code without restrction
  * Community: open to accept criticism, contributions & collaboration


Who uses open source?
=====================

.. note::

    Browsers (Firefox, Chromium)
    OSes and servers (Linux, BSD)
    Phones (Android, Firefox)
    Web servers (Apache/Nginx)
    Databases (MySQL/MariaDB, Postgres)
    Web sites (CMSes, platforms, frameworks)
    Programming languages (Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl…)




.. rst-class:: build

* Me
* You
* (Essentially) everyone!
* 2010: 98% of top 300 companies in USA
* ... Open source logos ...
* Closed source uses open source as well:

  * iOS, Mac OS X, Google Drive, Twitter, Facebook...
  * They release a lot of code as open source as well.


How does this benefit me?
=========================

    What do you call a Linux volunteer who just contributed his or her 6th patch
    to the Linux kernel? **Hired**.

.. note::

    The joke is that after 5, you'll already have a job offer.

    The complete article is well worth a read, and covers essentially
    everything that I've talked about.


Open source, open resume
========================

.. note::

    Improve your knowledge, skills:  version control, project methodology,
    negotiation/collaboration, planning, discussion, coding standards,
    industry best practices, expand specific tool and language skills,
    discovery

    Reduce effort: re-use free code and benefit.  I would never succeed on
    projects without open source; I just don't have the skill or time.

    Job offers: Employers are looking at your public profile; just like how
    they're looking at those photos of you on Facebook, they want to see your
    (positive) contributions.  Sometimes this will happen automatically --
    employers are out there.  I've had several job offers so far.

    Stand on the shoulders of giants: reap the benefits.  Build upon open code
    from others, add features, rework functionality, contribute fixes back to
    the world at large.

    You're not alone: I typically work alone, but I work with all these people
    beside me.  For me, I'll probably never meet these people.  For someone
    else, I'm one of their team of 1000s of people and I might well never
    know.  That's an interesting feeling.

    The open source community is likely to be more receptive to support
    requests.  I can't count the number of times I've had to deal with company
    support staff that either don't understand, can't help, or don't care.
    Dealing directly with a contributor on a software project means they can
    make a difference!

    Connecting with IT in the wild:  I'm alone in an office in Townsville, but
    I can actually be an integral part of development.  Numerous bugs I've
    fixed and issues I've reported have affected many others. 

    You might even help yourself.  I've done that plenty of times.

    Your contributions are yours: they associated with you, so you & others
    can track them.  This helps if you need to find that code you wrote a
    while back or are publicising yourself for a job. 

* Improve knowledge and skills:

  * Technical tools
  * Project methodology
  * Negotiation and collaboration
  * Planning
  * Discussion and communication
  * Industry best practices
  * ... so much more ...

* Reduce effort: save time, energy, money and stop reinventing the wheel.  If
  you've had a problem, someone else may well have already solved it.

  Being consistent in your coding and storage means you can always find what
  you worked on.

* Job offers:

  * Employers are looking at your public profile
  * Your contributions are yours, forever
  * Open source code = automatic CV/resume

* Make a difference:

  * Your contributions will help others and theirs will help you.
  * You might even help yourself...
  * You can make a difference anywhere, even Townsville.

* Connect with the world:

  * Be part of a huge team; one you may never meet
  * Most IT development happens overseas, typically capitals
  * Just because we're *isolated* doesn't mean anything.


Getting started
===============

.. note::

    Condition yourself: Be open to new ideas. Remember there are lots of good
    ideas and technology out there. Reinventing the wheel is okay, if there's
    a good reason.  Make sure it's a good one before you do.

    Create social coding profiles:  get a GitHub and Bitbucket profile.  You
    get a lot for free, including code hosting.  Social coding platforms and
    social media are great starting points.  If you're not familiar with
    version control, learn through free tutorials.

    Check out OpenHatch: complete 'training m issions' and gain skills. Find
    simple(ish) tasks to work on.

    Contribute back: If you're working with open
    technologies, and notice something wrong, create an issue.  Work with the
    developer to see it through.

    Target open source: Actively seek and power your projects with open
    source -- make sure they're free and unencumbered.  If something goes
    wrong, you can fix it or debug it and you're guaranteed later versions
    will be free too.

    Release your own code: You can charge f
    or support, ask for donations for feature requests, etc, but odds are
    you'll benefit from people using and contributing to your own code, if
    it's open and free.

    Be open and accepting:  Remember that others out there could be making
    their very first contribution to open source too.  You might beneFind
    projects you're interested in: If something doesn't work correctly, don 't
    get upset, jump in and help sort it out.  Noone is perfect, and software
    is just the same.  Odds are if you've hit a bug, someone else will soon
    (or has already).

    Attend conferences, user groups:  mostly major cities in Australia, but
    there's always room for more groups in region Centres.

    Open resume: Create an online resume and make it open too.  Consider
    making an open source repo for your resume.  There's coding tools like
    JSONResume that you can use to create beautiful looking resumes.

ticket discounts. If not, watch online.

Myth busting
============

It's all about coding, I can't help:  code is the core, but you don't have to programme to make a difference.  Anyone can report bugs and contribute to an open bug reports, or suggest features. Adding or editing documentation is usually just as easy to fix speling mistakes. 
I can do it myself:  With open source, you can make projects you never dreamed of or would never have the time to handle.  Stand on the shoulders of giants.  It's safter and quicker in the short term, and long term.  Try implementing a web server from scratch.  If you've got 123 years (Nginx, OpenHub) and $6.7m, go for it.  You might succeed, and maybe you can buy yourself a community too.  Good luck.  Alternatively, I promise to do this for you & maintain it forever for $6m...interested?   If something really bugs you, submit a patch.  If something really, really bugs you (MySQL → MariaDB, OpenOffice → LibreOffice), fork the project.  You're probably not alone. 
This software isn't safe:  having open source code is safer than closed source.  Communities have 'responsible disclosure' frameworks and tend to care because it reflects on them.  Regular audits are possible because you and others can see and review the code.
I can't get support: With open source code, you have flexibility and a wide range of people with skill in your software.  Flexibility to choose, more than just 1 vendor,  as the software is open, or use the community for free.  The community grows together, everyone wins.
Can't make money: run software as a service (skilled people will run their own, you charge for service for those that can't be bothered),  payment for support (Enterprise support, eg Canonical/Ubuntu), feature additions, donations, Gittip.  Getting a good job sounds pretty beneficial to me!
People will steal my ideas: licensing controls how code is used, you maintain copyright (although you don't have to, public domain is possible), commits are recorded with your details.  Theft is always possible, but you're shipping software: piracy is always a fact of life.  FYI: if you've got some magic secret sauce to a startup, then you can definitely keep it to yourself; consider making libraries, support code, other things you can benefit from help with.


Conclusion
==========

Open source is fundamental to all software development
Start building your portfolio through your contributions:  it happens automatically
It's easy to get started: use open source projects in your own work, report bugs, contribute some code
Make your code open: open code helps others with similar problems. Promote your open code, people will eventually find you.
Actively seek and power your projects with open source.
Remember you have the right to change their code! 
If you make improvements submit a pull request or patch back to the original author
Everyone grows together.
Provide prospective employers with your public profile URLs up front and explain what you've done.
Follow your passions:  if you're interested in getting further involved, projects may have ways of being part of code review teams, issue triage, support, etc.  IRC channels, and so forth.
