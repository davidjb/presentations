Are you...
==========

* Looking for ways to improve your career prospects?
* Want new skills to open up a range of opportunities?
* Want an instant portfolio to show your future employers?
* Think you'd like to make a real difference to real-world projects?

Let's look at how **open source** can help with all of the above!


Who am I?
=========

* IT Honours graduate from JCU in 2008
* Worked with the JCU eResearch Centre since

* Developer (web applications)
* System automator and administrator (Linux, Salt, Vagrant)
* Project manager
* Software to support research and development

* Work primarily with open source

  * Professional work would fall short
  * My personal projects wouldn't succeed
  * I simply couldn't do as much.


What is open source?
====================

Say wha?
